# Icons

To create new icons, you can use the following tools:

* Download icon from [Ikonate](https://ikonate.com/) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/mikolajdobrucki/ikonate).
* Export them with border 4 and color #000000.
* Use them directly on [Boytacean](https://github.com/joamag/boytacean) or [EmuKit](https://github.com/joamag/emukit).
