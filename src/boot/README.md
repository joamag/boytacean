## 2BPP file format

To convert a PNG into the 2BPP format, use the following command:

```bash
rgbgfx -Z -c embedded -t logo.tilemap -o logo.2bpp logo.png
```

To reverse the 2bpp files to PNG, use the following command:

```bash
rgbgfx -Z -r 16 -o logo.2bpp -t logo.tilemap logo.reverse.png
```

To run the complete process with compression and de-compression use the following command:

```bash
rgbgfx -Z -c embedded -t logo.tilemap -o logo.2bpp logo.png
python pb12.py compress logo.2bpp logo.pb12
python pb12.py decompress logo.pb12 logo.decompress.2bpp
rgbgfx -Z -r 16 -o logo.decompress.2bpp -t logo.tilemap logo.reverse.png
```
