## Features

* Game Boy (DMG) and Game Boy Color (CGB) emulation
* Simple navigable source-code

* Serial Data Transfer ([Link Cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Link_Cable)) support
* Game Boy Printer emulation
* Support for multiple MBCs: MBC1, MBC3, and MBC5

## Web front-end

The Web front-end makes use of [EmuKit](https://github.com/joamag/emukit) which is a UI toolkit that provides the required infrastructure for the creation
of interfaces for emulation in a Web context.

### Configuration

You can use some GET parameters to control the initial behavior of the emulator.

| Parameter    | Type    | Description                                                                                    |

| `fullscreen` | Boolean | If the emulator should start in fullscreen mode.                                               |
| `fs`         | Boolean | The same as `fullscreen`.                                                                      |
